# Etana

Developed Etana using C# and Unity for Papunet Kehitysvammaliitto. In this game, players guide Etsku the snail, keeping him alive by eating strawberries and avoiding falling rocks. Strategic use of Etskuâ€™s shell for protection is critical, but players must be cautious not to stay in the shell too long to prevent suffocation.

Key Features:

- Gain health and points by consuming strawberries
- Avoid falling rocks to prevent health and point loss
- Achieve 300 points to win the game
